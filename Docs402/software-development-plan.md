# 4.0 Software Development Plan

## 4.1 Plan Introduction
Vendyr is an application that aims to bridge the gap between buyers and sellers within a college community by providing them with a means of direct communication. Within the application, users will be able to search, sell, purchase, post, and track goods. The distinction between Vendyr and other similar existing applications is its exclusive availability to verified college students when they signup using a valid .edu email address. Vendyr will be accessible through Android and iOS devices as well as through web browsers. In developing the application, the tasks required for each project member compose of becoming familiar with the database (i.e., Firebase) for storing and retrieving data about users and items, learning the language needed for developing in each (i.e., Swift for iOS, Java for Android, and JavaScript for web), and collaboratively creating the user interface for each of the three platforms mentioned above and implementing a robust search functionality.

Within the scope of using Firebase, each member should accomplish the following tasks by the designated deadlines:
-   Facebook login (03/05)
-   Set up anonymous account to allow limited site use without login
-   Set up item deletion
-   Set up item sold and item deleted parameters
-   Track viewed items for each user
-   Implement tagging system
-   Track how much items are sold for

Creating the user interface should be accomplished by the following deadlines:
-   Redesign signup (02/27)
-   Homepage redesign (03/05)
-   Fix messages page to work on mobile platforms
-   Add functionality to navbar search
-   Setup detail view
-   Add side navigation bar button for mobile views
-   Resize uploaded images


Testing the product should be accomplished by the following date:
-   Beta Testing (04/01)
-   MVP User Interface (04/01)

## 4.3 Project Organization
Members of this project will be split into three categories: project lead, team lead, and team member. Each position inheriting all the responsibilities of the one below it. The project is also divided into three teams: web, android, and iOS. A member of any given team is expected to contribute to that teamâ€™s individual section of the project. For example, in the case of the iOS team, that would mean contributing to the iOS app the team is developing for the project. Each team will also have a team lead, a moderator who, in addition to contributing to the project on his or her own, will delegate work to his or her self as well as the team members. Team leads are also expected to host scrum meetings on a weekly basis with his or her team. The project lead presides over the team leads and serves as a central hub for information on the project. The project lead will direct the team leads as well as act as a member of a team. In addition, the project lead will host a project scrum consisting of every member of every team on the project.

## 4.4 Project Schedule
Each team will work on their respective parts of the application but all teams should be on the same page of what is completed each week. We have a list of features that must completed for a minimum viable product which are detailed in the GANTT Chart.
The task and resource table outlines who's completing what and with what hardware and software they will be using.
