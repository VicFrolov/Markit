## Verbal Description:
This is a continuation of a previous project, Markit, that sets the app up for a public release. In addition to working on the app within the Senior Project class, I will be working on the development with the business incubator program. As such, much of the work I do on the application will be dictated by market research conducted by a team from the business school. This means that I will be regularly changing my development plan to adapt to the intended users and their experiences using the app.

## Justification:
Markit aims to create, maintain, and expand a comfortable environment in which college students can buy, share, and trade goods without the search.
In the summer of 2016, my parents contacted me explaining that they would no longer be providing me with any living expenses—not because they were “cutting me off” but simply because they were no longer able to. This came on the heels of my roommates all leaving our off-campus home to graduate or move elsewhere. My remaining roommate and I found ourselves with a long list of things to buy and very little cash to at our disposal. After long hours scouring the internet for every possible deal we could find with questionable results, we discovered the solution much closer to home. We could simply turn to our fellow college students and alumni. We ended up utilizing our college’s “Free and For Sale” page to furnish our entire home. There is a trust that exists within the community of a college campus, and even throughout college campuses to an extent, and it is this willingness to share that allowed me to retain my independence well beyond the summer of 2016.
College students today have a thriving community of people around them without a means to efficiently tap into it. We want to help this community to grow and become more interconnected. With Markit, students have a single, safe place to reach out to their peers across their own universities, across campuses, and throughout the country.
Working on this project will require me to use concepts and ideas I learned from past classes. For example, lessons from Interaction Design (CMSI 370) would be useful when designing the graphical user interfaces of the application and altering the app in accordance to user feedback. Data structures (CMSI 281) and Algorithms (CMSI 282) would be useful when sorting and retrieving information quickly for the user. The programming paradigms we learned from Programming Languages (CMSI 385) can aid us in optimizing the codebase while learning platform-specific languages.
